Presented at [Brown Summer Research Symposium, 2020](https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/item/bdr:1139271/), funded by the [Karen T. Romer Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/fellowships/utra/). 

We investigate the underlying mechanisms of counterfactual reasoning, particularly the structures used to compute ad-hoc implicatures. This is the first report on a series of ongoing experiments to formalize how sets of alternatives are generated in iterative rationality models.
